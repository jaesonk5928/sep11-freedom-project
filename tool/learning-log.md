* Today, I wacthed this tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRWKxB9Hm0&list=PLDyH9Tk5ZdFzEu_izyqgPFtHJJXkc79no&index=3) about how to set up Phaser (my tool) without any error.
  * This allows me to code games or cool interative websites in my **IDE**. It had many steps, requiring to download a specific Javascript file with Phaser in it.
    * After, I had to create a new `html` file to eb able to code html elements in seperate windows.
  * Lastly, I had to download a web server for "_security reasons_".
* After following the steps from the video, I did manage to follow the steps, but then I got stuck on how to change the "web server" prefrences. I still need to set up **Phaser**.
* I will try to make the Phaser work in my IDE and tinker with the tool.
