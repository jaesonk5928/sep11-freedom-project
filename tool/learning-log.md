* Today, I wacthed this tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRWKxB9Hm0&list=PLDyH9Tk5ZdFzEu_izyqgPFtHJJXkc79no&index=3) about how to set up Phaser (my tool) without any error.
  * This allows me to code games or cool interative websites in my **IDE**. It had many steps, requiring to download a specific Javascript file with Phaser in it.
    * After, I had to create a new `html` file to eb able to code html elements in seperate windows.
  * Lastly, I had to download a web server for "_security reasons_".
* After following the steps from the video, I did manage to follow the steps, but then I got stuck on how to change the "web server" prefrences. I still need to set up **Phaser**.
* I will try to make the Phaser work in my IDE and tinker with the tool.

### 10/27/25:
* Today, I watched some videos from this [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRWKxB9Hm0&list=PLDyH9Tk5ZdFzEu_izyqgPFtHJJXkc79no&index=1) about Phaser Setup and Basics.
  * I watched Episodes 1 to 5. It goes from basic Phaser setup by making **folders** & **files**
  * After, the videos explain how Phaser **scenes** work by downloading _pngs_.
  * It also describes what sprites are and how it affects the scenes to help run smoothly.
  * Lastly, my favorite part was when it showed some starter code on how to animate/move the "**objects**" or sprites by using **X** and **Y**
  axes. It is very important in terms of games.
* Some challenges that I faced during watching the video and following the lessons/code were:
  * The ability to locate images that load into the game, due to not me linking the pathway to let it load.
  * Accidentally added an additional Phaser download link in my **html** server, allowing Phaser to not function.
* My next steps are to add movement keys to characters/image background, and add some sound to the Phaser tinker game. It will be more fun then today!
