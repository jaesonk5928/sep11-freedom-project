### Content
The tool I decided on for my _Freedom Project_ is **Phaser**. The reason I chose **Phaser** was because I wanted to make a _2D_ game of a adventure/survival game. I wanted my final product to be similar to either _Minecraft_ or _Granny_. They both envolve picking up items to help you along with your "_journey_". When setting up Phaser, I watched a tutorial video [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRWKxB9Hm0&list=PLDyH9Tk5ZdFzEu_izyqgPFtHJJXkc79no&index=1) (click the link); It basically has step by step "tasks" that help you get the concept of what Phaser can offer. For example, both the 1st and 2nd video in the playlist explains how to set up Phaser and make beautiful scenes that are important when making games. I followed the video and copied/pasted the starter code that allowed me to create a **scene** in the background. Also, I used images that were needed to _animate_ them to fall at a specific speed. For example, when the `speed += 1`, I manipulated the number, determining how fast the ships would fall. I changed the **1** into a **3**, allowing the ship's gravity speed to increase by a factor of 2. This is a way that I tinkered with **Phaser**.
