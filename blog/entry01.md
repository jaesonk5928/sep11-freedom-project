### Content
The tool I decided on for my _Freedom Project_ is **Phaser**. The reason I chose **Phaser** was because I wanted to make a _2D_ adventure/survival game. I want my final product to be similar to either _Minecraft_ or _Granny_. They both involve picking up items to help you along with your "_journey_". When setting up Phaser, I watched a tutorial video [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRWKxB9Hm0&list=PLDyH9Tk5ZdFzEu_izyqgPFtHJJXkc79no&index=1) (click the link); it basically has step-by-step "tasks" that help you get the concept of what Phaser can offer. For example, both the 1st and 2nd videos in the playlist explain how to set up Phaser and make beautiful scenes that are important when making games. I followed the video and copied/pasted the starter code that allowed me to create a **scene** in the background. Also, I used images that were needed to _animate_ them to fall at a specific speed. For example, when the `speed += 1`, I manipulated the number, determining how fast the ships would fall. I changed the **1** into a **3**, allowing the ship's gravity speed to increase by a factor of 2. This is a way that I tinkered with **Phaser**.

### Sources
Some **_sources_** that I am currently using to help me use **Phaser** are the [_playlist_]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRWKxB9Hm0&list=PLDyH9Tk5ZdFzEu_izyqgPFtHJJXkc79no&index=1)) mentioned above. Another source that would help me would be the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) website itself. There is also a "[Get Started](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-phaser-launcher)" page that tells you how to set up Phaser (by copying/pasting the link) in your **IDE** and what you can do by coding. Some tools that I also was considering to use for my game project were either [**Kaboom**](https://kaboomjs.com/) and/or [**Three.js**](https://threejs.org/). Both were cool, as **Kaboom** looked very **easy/simple** to code on, while **Three.js** was also fasinating, as my mind wanted to created a 3D version of my game.

### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
Currently, I am on step 1 of the **Engineering Design Process**, "Defining the Problem". Twitter (or X) for example, is a very useful social media app that allows people (any brands, every day people, youtubers, CEOs and even U.S. presidents!) to tweet a message/opinion, open to the public to read and comment on it. It could range from good to harmful messages. This is a problem, as Twitter's moderation is very messed up. It allowed users to take advantage of this and tweet very **harmful messages** that target mainly teens that caused them to not be safe. This made people stressed/depressed over talking to strangers such as **catfishes** and **predators**. This needs to stop.

### Skills
Some skills that I've improved on are **Collaboration** and **Communication**.

#### Collaboration
For this blog entry, I collaborated very often with **classmates** & **teachers** to help/to get help. For example, my partner **David** needed help downloading his tool in his IDE, so he asked me to help and I gladly helped David. I showed him where to find the resources and etc.

#### Communcation
Really, it's the same reason why the
