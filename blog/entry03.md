### Content
As of right now, I have finished & moved on from this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRWKxB9Hm0&list=PLDyH9Tk5ZdFzEu_izyqgPFtHJJXkc79no&index=1) to another video that basically applies all the **Phaser** principles to make a fully, _functional_ "tic-tac-toe" game. Here is the link to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3a9hArGa_E). I watched the video from the beginning to **this** specific time frame -> _**0:00**_ - _**6:15**_. I can summarize each section of the video:
* 0:00 - 3:00
  * It talks about the breakdown of each task on how to set up Phaser, along with a **template**
* 3:01 - 6:15
  * After, the guy in the video talks about how to do game configuration and add **assets**.

To show the video task breakdown:
```html
Project Task List
- [ ] download & setup project template
- [ ] update game config
- [ ] load in assets
- [ ] draw game board
- [ ] draw game pieces
- [ ] interact with game pieces and toggle frames
- [ ] create basic tic tac toe class
- [ ] handle players making a move
- [ ] add getters to tic tac toe class
- [ ] connect tic tac toe class to phaser scene
```
Some **code snippets**:
```js
"key": "bg1",
    "frameRate": 8,
    "repeat": -1,
    "assetKey": "bg1"
  },
  {
    "key": "bg2",
    "frameRate": 8,
    "repeat": -1,
    "assetKey": "bg2"
  },
  {
    "key": "bg3",
    "frameRate": 8,
    "repeat": -1,
    "assetKey": "bg3"
  }
```
This code uses javascript into background for the tic-tac-toe game that uses **frames** and `repeat` to register for the game's mechanic of clicking into the background to play. This was one of my goals during the winter break.

### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
After my second (2nd) **blog entry**, I said that I was on Step 2 of the EDP: "**Researching the Problem**". Currently im at the 3rd step of the _Engineering Design Process_: "**Brainstorm Possible Solution(s)**". I came up with some solutions that could possibly help with social **safety**. The problem with texting people you know little could pose a dangerous harm to your "account". I would change it so that you have to do a "**double check**" thing to people you don't trust.

### Skills
Some skills that I have improved on are **Time Management** and **Consideration**.

#### Time Management
The main reason I improved on **Time Management** is prioritizng family instead of doing other things like doing homework/sleeping. I followed my siblings and helped them with their chores first, **then** do homework.

#### Consideration
I've improved my skill of **Consideration** by making better choices for the greater good/outcome. For example, I was laying down on the couch when the **snowstorm** hit a few weeks ago. I considered sleeping during the storm, but realized I needed to go out to buy groceries for cooking. I had to consider shoveling the snow rather then sleeping.
